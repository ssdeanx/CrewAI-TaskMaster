## Detailed Tools Description

### 1. `request_planning`
- **Purpose:**  
  Initializes the workflow by registering a new user request and planning the associated tasks.
- **Detailed Description:**  
  This tool captures the initial user input, outlines the tasks to be performed, and sets baseline parameters for the workflow. It serves as the starting point for all subsequent operations, storing key details such as the overall request description, task titles, and task descriptions. It also records optional parameters (like priority and due dates) that influence scheduling and execution.
- **Parameters:**  
  - `originalRequest` (string): A detailed description of the user's need.
  - `tasks` (array): A list of tasks; each task is an object containing:
    - `title` (string): A brief, descriptive title.
    - `description` (string): A comprehensive explanation of the task.
  - Optional:
    - `splitDetails` (string): Additional instructions or breakdown details.
    - `priority` (string): Task priority using the **Priority Enum** (default: `MEDIUM`).
    - `dueDate` (string): Expected completion date in "YYYY-MM-DD" format.

### 2. `get_next_task`
- **Purpose:**  
  Determines and retrieves the next pending task or subtask that should be executed.
- **Detailed Description:**  
  This tool serves as the scheduling engine, evaluating pending tasks based on a combination of static parameters (such as priority and due dates) and dynamic factors (like context scores derived from real-time system data). It returns comprehensive details about the next actionable task, including task ID, title, description, and any urgency metrics that influence its selection.
- **Parameters:**  
  - `requestId` (string): Unique identifier for the request.

### 3. `mark_task_done`
- **Purpose:**  
  Finalizes the execution of a task or subtask by marking it as completed or flagging it as pending (for asynchronous operations).
- **Detailed Description:**  
  This tool updates the status of a task in the system. It records key performance metrics (execution time, error occurrences, resource usage) for later analysis by the Insight Accumulator Module. The tool supports built-in retry mechanisms with exponential backoff and jitter, ensuring robust error handling. Its operation triggers logging that feeds into MLflow for continuous monitoring.
- **Parameters:**  
  - `requestId` (string): Unique request identifier.
  - `taskId` (string): Unique task identifier.
  - Optional:
    - `subtaskId` (string): Unique identifier for a subtask (if applicable).
    - `status` (string): Task status; must be a value from the **Status Enum** (default: `COMPLETED` for synchronous tasks, `PENDING` for asynchronous tasks).
    - `completedDetails` (string): Supplementary details or logs regarding task execution.

### 4. `approve_task_completion`
- **Purpose:**  
  Validates and approves the completion of a task or subtask.
- **Detailed Description:**  
  This tool ensures that a task has met all predefined quality and performance criteria before it can progress. It integrates with a decision engine that calculates a confidence score based on logged metrics. If the confidence score exceeds the AutoDecisionThreshold, the system auto-approves the task (Role: `AUTO`); otherwise, a human Agent (`AGENT`) or Manager (`MANAGER`) must provide confirmation. This process not only enforces quality but also contributes data for refining auto-approval mechanisms.
- **Parameters:**  
  - `requestId` (string): Unique identifier for the request.
  - `taskId` (string): Identifier for the task.

### 5. `approve_request_completion`
- **Purpose:**  
  Provides the final approval that the entire request has been successfully completed.
- **Detailed Description:**  
  Once all individual tasks and subtasks have been completed and approved, this tool is used to finalize the entire request. It performs a final check to ensure all workflow conditions are met and then marks the request as complete. Similar to task approvals, auto-approval may occur based on a high confidence score if human intervention is not available.
- **Parameters:**  
  - `requestId` (string): Unique identifier for the request.

### 6. `open_task_details`
- **Purpose:**  
  Retrieves comprehensive details about a specific task.
- **Detailed Description:**

# System Instructions: Task Management Workflow (Task Master v2 Complete - Part 3: Workflow Integration)

## Overview

This section describes how the individual tools and advanced modules interconnect to form a fully autonomous workflow. The system integrates real-time context, reinforcement learning (RL), meta-learning, robust error handling, and dynamic resource management. The goal is to optimize task scheduling, branching decisions, and auto-approval processes while ensuring transparency and continuous improvement via MLflow dashboards.

## Detailed Workflow Integration

### 1. Request Initialization and Baseline Setup
- **Trigger & Input:**  
  - A user or an automated system (e.g., an LLM/prompt agent) submits a request via the `request_planning` tool.  
  - The submitted request includes the `originalRequest` text, an array of defined tasks (each with a `title` and `description`), and optional parameters such as `splitDetails`, `priority` (from the Priority Enum), and `dueDate`.
- **Process:**  
  - The system generates a unique `requestId` for the workflow.  
  - The baseline request data and initial task list are logged and forwarded to MLflow for historical tracking.
- **Outcome:**  
  - The workflow is initialized with a clear state that serves as the starting point for scheduling and execution.

### 2. Dynamic Task Scheduling and Retrieval
- **Next Task Selection:**  
  - The `get_next_task` tool is called using the `requestId`.
  - **Data Sources:**  
    - Static parameters: task priority (HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW) and due date.
    - Dynamic parameters: real-time context scores computed by the Context Monitor Module (reflecting current system load, resource availability, etc.).
    - Historical performance metrics (collected from previous tasks) that influence urgency.
- **Integration with RL:**  
  - The RL module processes these inputs and adjusts the ranking of tasks by updating its Q-values or policy outputs.
  - The tool returns detailed information for the next task (including taskId, title, description, and urgency/context score).
- **Outcome:**  
  - The system identifies the most critical pending task, ensuring that high-urgency items are prioritized.

### 3. Task Execution, Logging, and Performance Capture
- **Synchronous Task Execution:**  
  - The retrieved task is executed immediately.
  - Upon completion, `mark_task_done` is invoked with:
    - `requestId` and `taskId`
    - `status` set to `COMPLETED` (from the Status Enum)
    - Optional `completedDetails` summarizing execution logs.
  - **Performance Capture:**  
    - Metrics such as execution time, error count, and resource usage are recorded.
    - These metrics are immediately logged and sent to the Insight Accumulator Module and MLflow.
- **Asynchronous Task Execution:**  
  - The task is flagged as pending using `mark_task_done` with `status` set to `PENDING`.
  - The external process (or sub-agent) executes the task.
  - Once completed (or if an error occurs), `notify_task_event` is called with:
    - The corresponding `event` value (`COMPLETED` or `FAILED` from the Event Enum)
    - Any `completedDetails` regarding the event.
  - **Data Capture:**  
    - The event notification updates the task status and logs performance metrics.
- **Outcome:**  
  - Task completion (or failure) is recorded accurately, with full performance data captured for subsequent analysis.

### 4. Subtask Management and Approval Process
- **Subtask Creation:**  
  - For complex tasks, `create_subtasks` is used to decompose the task into multiple subtasks.
  - Each subtask is defined with its own `title` and `description`, with optional parameters for `priority` and `dueDate`.
- **Subtask Execution:**  
  - Each subtask is processed through the same execution pipeline (retrieval, execution, and marking as done) as standalone tasks.
- **Approval Workflow for Subtasks:**  
  - After a subtask is completed, `approve_task_completion` is invoked.
  - **Auto-Approval Decision:**  
    - A decision engine calculates a confidence score based on the subtask’s performance metrics (execution time, error rate, etc.).
    - If the confidence score exceeds the AutoDecisionThreshold, the subtask is auto-approved (recorded with Role `AUTO`).
    - Otherwise, the system waits for manual confirmation from an Agent (`AGENT`) or Manager (`MANAGER`).
  - **Outcome Logging:**  
    - Approval events (whether auto or manual) are logged with timestamps and role information, feeding back to the RL module to refine future decisions.
- **Parent Task Completion:**  
  - Once all subtasks are individually approved, `mark_task_done` is used to mark the parent task as completed.
- **Outcome:**  
  - The detailed subtask execution and approval process ensures granular tracking and quality control.

### 5. Iterative Task Processing and Continuous Adaptation
- **Loop Execution:**  
  - After a task (or subtask) is approved, the system re-invokes `get_next_task` to fetch the next pending task.
  - This iterative loop continues until all tasks and subtasks in the request are executed and approved.
- **Continuous Learning:**  
  - The RL module continuously updates its policy based on real-time performance data collected via the Insight Accumulator.
  - The Meta-Learning Engine aggregates historical data periodically, recalibrating long-term parameters like auto_decision_threshold and informing the RL module.
- **Outcome:**  
  - The system dynamically adapts its scheduling and approval thresholds to optimize throughput and quality.

### 6. Request Completion and Final Approval
- **Final Check:**  
  - When `get_next_task` returns no pending tasks, the system prepares for final review.
- **Final Approval:**  
  - `approve_request_completion` is called with the `requestId`.
  - The decision engine reviews overall request performance, and auto-approval may occur if the cumulative confidence score is high.
- **Outcome:**  
  - The entire request is marked as complete, and final metrics are logged for future learning and audit purposes.

### 7. Continuous Monitoring, Feedback, and Error Recovery
- **Insight Accumulation:**  
  - The Insight Accumulator Module continuously aggregates detailed performance metrics from every task and subtask.
  - These insights are fed into the reward function, which outputs a composite float reward signal (between -1.0 and 1.0).
- **Feedback Loop:**  
  - The RL module uses the reward signal to refine scheduling, branching, and auto-approval decisions.
  - MLflow dashboards visualize these metrics in real time, providing transparency and facilitating manual adjustments if necessary.
- **Error Handling:**  
  - Configurable retry strategies (e.g., max_retries and backoff_interval) are applied to asynchronous tasks.
  - Circuit breakers and fallback paths are triggered when persistent errors occur, ensuring minimal disruption.
- **Outcome:**  
  - The system maintains a robust, self-improving workflow that continuously adapts to changes and recovers from errors.
